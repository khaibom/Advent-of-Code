# 🎄 Advent of Code 2025 — Polyglot Edition 💻👨‍🍳

### Welcome to my Advent of Code 2025 project — but with a twist.
Instead of solving everything in one language, I’m turning December 2025 into a programming buffet worthy of an Italian grandma.

Every day’s puzzle will be solved in a different programming language.
Why?
Because:
- I love **PAIN** ☠️
- Learning is fun ☠️
- And why not write spaghetti in as many languages as possible? 🍝
- Also, this year I want to code like I’m mixing **linguine, fettuccine, lasagne, macaroni, ...** in the same pot. 🥘

(Which is also how some/all of my solutions will look.)

⸻

## 🚀 Goal

Use Advent of Code as an excuse to explore, revisit, and maybe even suffer through a wide variety of languages — from elegant to cursed.

Each day = one puzzle = one language.
A daily serving of fresh code **al dente**.

- No repeats
- No regrets
- **No Protein - Only Carbs** 💪

(Okay, maybe some regrets — especially on days when the code turns into cold, sticky noodle hell.)
